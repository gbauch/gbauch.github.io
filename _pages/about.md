I am a postdoc at the [Center for Mathematical Economics](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/zwe/imw/) and the [CeUS](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/einrichtungen/ceus/) as well as an associated postdoc within the [CUDE](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/zwe/imw/cude/) research training group at Bielefeld University. There, I have recently finished my doctoral studies under the supervision of [Prof. Frank Riedel](https://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/friedel/) and [Prof. Andreas Blume](https://sites.google.com/site/andreas3blume/) from the University of Arizona.

<p>My research interests include game and decision theory under uncertainty and their application to languages and partnership dissolutions.<br>I further fancy complex analysis and coding theory.</p>

Before coming to Bielefeld, I've graduated in mathematics at Heidelberg University under the supervision of [Prof. Rainer Weissauer](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rainer-Weissauer) on a conjecture on Siegel modular forms.
