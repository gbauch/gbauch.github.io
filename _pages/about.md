I am a last year PhD student at the Center for Mathematical Economics at Bielefeld University under the supervision of Prof. Frank Riedel. Before coming to Bielefeld, I've been a master student in mathametics at Heidelberg University.

<p>My research interest include game and decision theory under uncertainty and their application to languages and partnership dissolutions.<br>Furthermore, I fancy complex analysis, esp. Siegel modular forms, and coding theory.</p>
